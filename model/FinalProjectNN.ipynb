    "This notebook contains multiple maching learning algorithms but the main focus was the use of neural network in an attempt to predict the outcomes of National Hockey League (NHL) games.<br> \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The models were trained on game data from 2020 to the present but there was multiple other datasets created that were required to complete the training and predictions of the 2022-23 season. The main dataset used was the game level data which required a lot of preprocessing. A new dataset was created from the original game level dataset to have all the desired features for each game on one row as opposed to multiple rows, which would not have been compatible to train the model. Also, other feature columns were created from the data to be used in the modeling. <br>\n",
    "The dataset required for the 2022-23 season that was used to make predictions also required extensive preprocessing as it also needed to be in the exact same format as the data used to originally train the model. In addition, I also utilized Principal Component Analysis to reduce the size of the dataset while still maintaining 99% of the information. This dataset was also used to train a model.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "I've included two models as a baseline, Logistic Classification and Random Forests, to measure the performance of the neural networks. I've tested many different architectures of neural networks and two have shown some very promising results. In my research, most models online state that they acheive around 60-65% accuracy and I have made multiple models that can slightly exceed this result now.<br>\n",

    "* I am very encouraged by the results of both Neural Network models. They both acheived my first goal of a higher accuracy than just choosing the home team to win every time and they are also both outperforming the models created on moneypuck.com. The PCA model does have a slightly higher Log Loss but did acheive higher accuracy.\n",
    "* Both models are currently predicting more home team wins but they are still about 4% under historical results.\n",
    "* Comparing predictions between the two models shows some similarity but also some big differences in some games. The PCA model also appears to have \n",
    "* I do believe however that I can still improve the results by adding new feature columns so further testing and adjustments to the network architecture would be required. \n",
    "  * In addition, the season is only 25% done so there isn't a lot of data on the current teams, so I would expect the models performance to increase as the season progresses."

    "* I would recommend further research and enhancements into advanced game statisctics and individual player statistics that could be added to either of the two Neural Network models to continue to improve their performance. Right now, the Neural Network without PCA would be the primary choice because of the training / testing accuarcy being fairly close to each other while being as high or higher than other models.\n",
    "* To start, I would recommend that playnow.com utilize the models for fantasy hockey as a way to initially measure the models results against live games. \n",
    "  * It can be used for futures / prop bets along with setting team rankings and values for fantasy hockey. \n",
    "* In the end, this can also be used to set betting odds and with slight modifications it couldbe include the point spread as well."
